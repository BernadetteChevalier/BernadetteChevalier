- 👋 Hi, I’m @BernadetteChevalier
- 👀 I'm a curious and passionate learner, interested in a wide range of topics. This makes me a perpetual learner always exploring new things.
- 🌱 Currently, as a teacher transitioning into a new career, I’ve decided to specialize in COBOL, which is the field I want to work in. 
- 💞️ I enjoy learning by doing and collaborating on projects.
  
- 😄 On my GitHub, you will find my training work, personal projects, contributions to open-source projects, and resources to learn and grow together.
